Meeting to discuss how to use github and also to decide on a plan (check state of the project, decide what needs to be done and how, delegate tasks)

Github Info:
-the most important feature of github that we will be using the the branching aspect, which allows to to merge document seamlessly
- get GitHub for desktop and clone the ComputationalMethods repository from web (use the link!)
- always work on the files that are in the cloned folder, if you want to be able to update your changes live
